    "text": "2.1 Keyboard shortcuts\nJupyter Notebooks are an interactive computing environment that allow users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Originally developed as part of the IPython project, Jupyter (short for Julia, Python, R) now supports over 100 programming languages and has become a standard tool in data science, scientific computing, and education.\nAt the core of a Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interface that organizes content into “cells.” These cells can contain code (typically in Python, but also in other languages via kernels), formatted text using Markdown, LaTeX for equations, and embedded multimedia elements. Users execute code in-place, and outputs such as plots or tables appear directly below the corresponding cells. This structure enables exploratory data analysis and facilitates reproducibility by interleaving code and its results with documentation.\nNotebooks are stored in .ipynb files (JSON format), which preserve the code, outputs, and formatting. They can be run locally using the Jupyter server or hosted in cloud environments such as Google Colab or Binder. For scientific workflows, notebooks can integrate with tools for version control, containerization, and workflow management, making them a flexible instrument for open and reproducible research.\nDespite their strengths, Jupyter Notebooks are not without limitations. Version control can be challenging due to the JSON-based format, and improper use (e.g., out-of-order execution) can compromise reproducibility. Nevertheless, their advantages in accessibility, interactivity, and communication have made them central to modern computational work.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Command Mode in Jupyter Notebooks\nIn Jupyter Notebooks, Command Mode is one of the two main interaction modes—the other being Edit Mode. Command Mode is active when the cell border is blue, indicating that keyboard commands will be interpreted as notebook-level operations rather than editing the cell’s content.\nCommand Mode allows users to manage cells and perform structural modifications without using the mouse. This enhances efficiency, especially when working with large notebooks. Pressing Esc while in a cell activates Command Mode.\n\nCommon 2.1.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortcut\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEnter\nSwitch to Edit Mode in the selected cell\n\n\nA\nInsert a new cell above the current cell\n\n\nB\nInsert a new cell below the current cell\n\n\nD, D\nDelete the selected cell (press D twice quickly)\n\n\nZ\nUndo the last cell deletion\n\n\nY\nChange cell type to code\n\n\nM\nChange cell type to Markdown\n\n\nC\nCopy the selected cell\n\n\nX\nCut the selected cell\n\n\nV\nPaste cell below\n\n\nShift + V\nPaste cell above\n\n\nShift + Up/Down\nExtend selection to multiple cells\n\n\nCtrl + S (or Cmd + S on macOS)\nSave the notebook\n\n\nH\nShow all keyboard shortcuts\n\n\n0, 0\nRestart the kernel (press 0 twice quickly)\n\n\nShift + M (in Command Mode)\nMerge selected cells\n\n\n\nThese shortcuts make navigation and cell management significantly faster, enabling an efficient coding and documentation workflow within Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Edit Mode in Jupyter Notebooks\nEdit Mode is activated when a cell’s border turns green, allowing the user to directly modify the contents of the cell. You can enter Edit Mode by pressing Enter while a cell is selected in Command Mode. This mode is primarily used for writing and editing code or Markdown content within cells.\n\nCommon 2.1.2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortcut\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCtrl + Enter\nRun the current cell and remain in Edit Mode\n\n\nShift + Enter\nRun the current cell and move to the next cell\n\n\nAlt + Enter\nRun the current cell and insert a new cell below\n\n\nEsc\nSwitch to Command Mode\n\n\nCtrl + /\nToggle comment on selected lines (code cells only)\n\n\nTab\nCode completion or indent\n\n\nShift + Tab\nShow tooltip/help for the object under cursor\n\n\nCtrl + ]\nIndent the current line or selection\n\n\nCtrl + [\nDedent the current line or selection\n\n\nCtrl + A\nSelect all content in the cell\n\n\nCtrl + Z\nUndo the last change\n\n\nCtrl + Y\nRedo the last undone change\n\n\nCtrl + Shift + -\nSplit the current cell at cursor position into two cells\n\n\nCtrl + S (or Cmd + S)\nSave the notebook\n\n\nCtrl + Shift + -\nSplit the cell at the current cursor position\n\n\n\nThese shortcuts are optimized for efficient coding and content editing, significantly reducing reliance on the mouse and improving productivity within Jupyter Notebooks.",
