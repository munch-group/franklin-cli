The course also outlines and discusses bioinformatics algorithms, and the most common tools for bioinformatics analysis of sequence data are presented and demo nstrated. The participant will acquire and train basic programming skills during the first seven weeks. The last seven weeks introduce key topics in bioinformatics, focusing on applying bioinformatical software and developing programming skills. Subjects for lectures and exercises include bioinformatics databases, sequence alignment, genome annotation, sequence evolution, and phylogenetic analysis.",
