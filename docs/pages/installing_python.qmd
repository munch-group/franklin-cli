title: Installing Python
---

You will need to install a modern distribution of Python on your computer. We recommend Miniforge. It is free, lightweight, and comes pre-configured with the community-maintained conda-forge channel, which has the most up-to-date scientific packages.

## On Mac

First, you need to know if your Mac has an Intel processor or Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3). To check, click the Apple menu in the top-left corner and choose "About This Mac". Look for the Chip or Processor information.

**For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs:**

1. Download the installer by opening Terminal and running:
   ```bash
   curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh"
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
   ```

**For Intel Macs:**

1. Download the installer by opening Terminal and running:
   ```bash
   curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
   ```

**For both types of Mac:**

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Press Enter to review the license
   - Press Space to scroll through the license
   - Type `yes` and press Enter to accept
   - Press Enter to confirm the installation location (or specify a different one)
   - When asked about initializing Miniforge3, type `yes`

4. Close and reopen your Terminal for the changes to take effect

5. Verify the installation by typing:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```
   You should see something like `conda 23.x.x`

## On Linux

1. Download the installer by opening a terminal and running:
   ```bash
   curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh"
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Press Enter to review the license
   - Press Space to scroll through the license
   - Type `yes` and press Enter to accept
   - Press Enter to confirm the installation location (or specify a different one)
   - When asked about initializing Miniforge3, type `yes`

4. Close and reopen your terminal for the changes to take effect

5. Verify the installation by typing:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```
   You should see something like `conda 23.x.x`

## On Windows

1. Download the installer from: 
   [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe)

2. Double-click the downloaded file to start the installer

3. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Click "Next" on the welcome screen
   - Click "I Agree" to accept the license
   - Choose "Just Me" for the installation type (recommended)
   - Keep the default installation path or choose a different one
   - **Important**: Check the box that says "Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable"
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for the installation to complete
   - Click "Next" and then "Finish"

4. Open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window

5. Verify the installation by typing:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```
   You should see something like `conda 23.x.x`

:::

Once Miniforge is installed, you have Conda on your system! The installation also:
- Sets up a "base" environment (your default Python environment)
- Configures conda-forge as your default package channel (where packages come from)
- Adds the `conda` command to your system so you can use it from any terminal

If the `conda --version` command doesn't work, try closing and reopening your terminal again. On some systems, you might need to log out and log back in for the changes to take full effect.

## Important Step After Installation

The Miniforge installer has set up a "base" environment for you that is automatically activated when you open your terminal. You should not install anything into that environment so you are better off disabling the automatic activation like this:

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```
