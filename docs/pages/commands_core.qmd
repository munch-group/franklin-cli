Franklin is a command line tool that your run from a terminal. If you are not famililiar with terminals, have a look at [this brief introduction](about/terminal.html) before you go on. 

Franklin uses the [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) library to define a hierarchy of commands and subcommands that you can run in the terminal. `franklin` is the main command and has the subcommands `download`, `jupyter`, `update`, `show`, and `cleanup`. Should you forget, you can always just run the `franklin` command like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin
```

to print the following help message:

```txt

## Run Jupyter

Your downloaded exercise is a jupyter notebook. In order to open and use it, you need a running jupyter with all the required dependencies installed. To spare you the trouble and to make sure everyone run the exercise the same way, franklin can run jupyter in way that exactly fits each exercise. To run jupyter for your downloaded exercise, first make sure you have navigated to the exercise folder using the terminal. Then run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin jupyter
```

JupyterLab opens in your browser. In the file menu in the right pane, you should be able to see your newly downloaded exercise. Open it by double-clicking it and you are ready to begin the exercise. To stop jupyter, simply close the browser window or press `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window (remember to save your notebook first).

Note: If the message below pops up, the folder you started franklin in was either not empty or you may have forgotten to go to the exercise subfolder![alt text](<images/Skærmbillede 2025-05-28 kl. 15.22.07.png>)

## Cleanup disk space

Franklin downloads a linux "docker image" for every exercise. These can take up a lot of space on your computer. Fortunately, you only need each one, when you run the exercise it is made for. So you can delete the ones you are not using to free up space. Franklin will automatically download them again if you need them later.

To see the images downloaded to your computer and how much space they take up, you can run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin show images
```
