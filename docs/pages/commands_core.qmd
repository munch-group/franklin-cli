**franklin** uses the [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) library to define a hierachy of commands and subcommands. `franklin` is the main command and has the subcommands `download`, `jupyter`, `update`, and `cleanup`. Should you forget, you can always run the `franklin` command like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin
```

to print the following help message:

## Update franklin
Franklin should update automaticaly when you start the program, but if you should need to update it manually you can use the command 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin update
```

You can also check out which version of franklin you have installed by using the command 

## Cleanup disk space

In order or your TØ exercises to run correctly an enviroment that is the same for each students computer is created in docker. These are also specific for each course and exercise. Unfortunately, these take up a fair ammount of space on your computer, so when you are done with a course it might be a good idea to delete these. 

You can easily do this by using the command franklin cleanup

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin cleanup
```

A seletion menu will then appear with all your currently downloaded docker images, named after each of your exercises. You can then use your arrow keys to select the exercise enviroments that you no longer use.

Note: deleting the exercise enviroments like this DO NOT delete the exercise you have made yourself and of you would ever need a specific enviroment for an old exercise again, you simple download it once more.
