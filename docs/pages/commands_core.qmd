Franklin is a command line tool that your run from a terminal. If you are not famililiar with terminals, have a look at [this brief introduction](about/terminal.html) before you go on. 

Franklin uses the [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) library to define a hierarchy of commands and subcommands that you can run in the terminal. `franklin` is the main command and has the subcommands `download`, `jupyter`, `update`, `show`, and `cleanup`. Should you forget, you can always just run the `franklin` command like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin
```

to print the following help message:

```txt
Usage: franklin [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A tool to download notebook exercises and run jupyter  in a way that fits
  each exercise.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  cleanup   Cleanup Franklin storage
  download  Download an exercise
  jupyter   Run jupyter for an exercise
  show      Commands for showing Docker content.

```

To run each subcommand, you simply append it to `franklin`, E.g. `franklin jupyter`. The following sections explain what each subcommand do.


## Download an exercise

The jupyter exercises are available for you to download onto your own computer. To do so, you just run the command below. You will be presented with menus to select the course and exercise you want to download. The downloaded exercise will appear as a folder in your current folder (you can run `ls` to see it). If the exercise is called `cool-exercise`, you can change to that folder by running `cd cool-exercise`.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin download
```

## Run Jupyter

In order to open and run the downloaded jupyter notebook, you need a running jupyter with all the required dependencies installed. To spare you the trouble and to make sure everyone run the exercise the same way, franklin can run jupyter in way that exactly fits each exercise. To run jupyter for your downloaded exercise, first make sure you have navigated to the exercise folder using the terminal. Then run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin jupyter
```

## Show Docker disk usage

The `franklin show` subcommand itself has the subcommands `images`, `containers`, and `storage`:

## Show Docker images

Franklin downloads a linux "docker image" for every exercise. These can take up a lot of space on your computer. Fortunately, you only need each one, when you run the exercise it is made for. So you can delete the ones you are not using to free up space. Franklin will automatically download them again if you need them later.

To see the images downloaded to your computer and how much space they take up, you can run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin show images
```


## Show Docker containers

Franklin starts a Docker Linux container when you run `franklin jupyter`. These can take up a lot of space on your computer. Fortunately, you only need each one, when you run the exercise it is made for. So you can delete the ones you are not using to free up space. Franklin will automatically download them again if you need them later.

To see the images downloaded to your computer and how much space they take up, you can run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin show images
```


## Show Docker storage

To see a summary of how much disk space Docker takes up on your computer for what purpose, you can run this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin show storage
```
