title: Developing exercises
---

Franklin is built for developing stable exercises, as well as for running them. The additional tools required for exercise creation and development are not part the core `franklin` package. Instead, it is distributed as the `franklin-educator` plugin. This setup ensures that educators use exactly the same code for testing exercises as students, while keeping the core student API lean and simple. To develop exercises, you must install both packages in an existing conda environment like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda install -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin-educator
```

Or make a new environment for just these packages using this command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda create -n franklin -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin-educator
```

## Pixi 

If you know your way around [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), you can also use that to install:

```{.bash}
pixi workspace channel add munch-group
pixi add franklin-educator
```

## Create a new exercise 

To create a new blank exercise, you use the command:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise new
```

The command presents you with menus to select your course and the name of the GitLab repository for the exercise. It then launches the GitLab settings page for the repository so you can add a title/name to the exercise and to make the repository public.

## Exercise edit workflow

To accommodate educators with different computational skill levels, franklin supports two different development workflows:

- **Automated:** A fully automated (but rigid) workflow for absolute beginners and for quick edits by more advanced users.
- **Assisted:** A semi-automated workflow for intermediate users allowing more flexibility.
- **Supported:** A fully flexible approach based on vscode devcontainers catering for skilled users.


## Removing (archiving) an exercise 

GitLab exercises are not deleted. We archive them instead, which makes them invisible to students. To archive a repository, first run this command which opens the the repository settings page:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise settings
```

Then find expand the "Advanced" section as the bottom and click the blue button that says "Archive project".
