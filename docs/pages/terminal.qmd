A terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It provides direct access to the system shellâ€”a program that interprets user input and executes corresponding instructions.

Historically, "terminals" referred to physical devices (e.g., teletypewriters or CRT monitors) connected to mainframe computers. In modern computing, a terminal is typically a software application (e.g., Terminal on macOS, GNOME Terminal on Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows) that emulates this interface.

Key characteristics of a terminal include:

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), a terminal requires textual input and returns textual output.
Shell Access: The terminal runs a shell such as bash, zsh, or fish, which interprets and executes user commands (e.g., file manipulation, process control, networking).
Script Execution: Users can run scripts, automate tasks, and chain commands using control operators (e.g., &&, |, >, etc.).
Remote Access: Terminals can be used to log into remote systems via protocols such as SSH, providing a low-overhead method for remote system administration and programming.
The terminal is a powerful tool, particularly in software development, system administration, and high-performance computing. It enables reproducibility, fine-grained control, and automation, though it requires users to become familiar with a command language and often lacks the immediate feedback and discoverability of graphical interfaces.
