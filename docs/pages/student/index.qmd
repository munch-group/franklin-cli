## Franklin

**Franklin** takes care of the technical challenges in running jupyter notebook exercise on your computer. That way, you can focus on learning rather than library incompatibilities and platform specific dependencies. 

Once installed, running lets you download the exercise you want.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin download
```

Running this command, starts a jupyter notebook on your computer that 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin jupyter
```

You can find more detail along with installation instructions and tutorials in the side bar.

Should you come across a bug or find yourself missing some functionality, you are welcome to [submit an issue](https://github.com/munch-group/franklin-cli/issues).
