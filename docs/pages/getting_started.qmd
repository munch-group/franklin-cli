**franklin** is an open source project with the goal of making teaching through Jupyter notebooks available to educators and students with little to no computational experience.

The tool allows students to focus on computational learning and to allow educators with non-computer science professors to use juptyer notebooks in their teaching without having to worry that exercises stop working or whether they work on every Windows and Mac computer in a large cohort of students.

## The student interface

The student run a jupyter notebook on their own computer in a way that lets them focus on content and learning without the frustration by library incompatibilities and platform specific dependencies. 

On both Mac and Windows, running the following command, prompts the student to select course and exercise and then downloads a folder with a jupyter notebook.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin download
```

The student runs the following command, which again prompts for course and exercise and launches JupyterLab from an environment on the student's computer with all required dependencies preinstalled.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin jupyter
```

The environment and notebook is exactly the same, wether on Mac or Windows, allowing them to work together, compare results, and receive uniform and unambiguous feedback from instructors.

## The educator interface

Educators with limited computational skills can develop and distribute jupyter exercises that will run year on year on the the diverse Mac and Windows computers of large cohorts of students.

Running the following command prompts the educator for course and exercise name and creates a new exercise. 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise new
```

The following command command prompts the educator for course and exercise. It then retrieves the exercise, launches jupyter in an appropriate environment, waits while the educator edits the notebook, and then automatically makes the edited notebook available to students in an environment automatically generated to accommodate any new dependencies resulting from changes to the notebook.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise edit
```

## Installing Pixi Package Manager

Franklin uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), a modern, fast package manager that's fully compatible with conda packages but offers better performance and reliability.

### Quick Install

::: {.panel-tabset}

### macOS/Linux
```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows
```{.powershell filename="PowerShell"}
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

:::

After installation, restart your terminal to ensure pixi is in your PATH.

## Installing Franklin

### For Students

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# Add the Franklin channel
pixi global install franklin --channel conda-forge --channel munch-group

# Verify installation
franklin --version
```

### For Educators

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# Install Franklin with educator tools
pixi global install franklin franklin-educator --channel conda-forge --channel munch-group

# Verify installation
franklin --version
franklin exercise --help
```

### Alternative: Conda Installation

If you prefer using conda/mamba:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# Students
conda install -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin

# Educators
conda install -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin franklin-educator
```

## Automatic Updates

Once installed, Franklin updates automatically through pixi's global sync mechanism. This ensures that any update or bugfix is automatically available to students.

To manually check for updates:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# Using pixi
pixi global update franklin

# Using conda
conda update -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin
```

## GitLab administrator setup

Franklin only requires a GitLab group named 'Franklin', with subgroups for each course holding the exercise repositories.
