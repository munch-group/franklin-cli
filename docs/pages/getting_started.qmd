**franklin** is an open source project with the goal of making teaching through Jupyter notebooks available to educators and students with little to no computational experience.

The tool allows students to focus on computational learning and to allow educators with non-computer science professors to use juptyer notebooks in their teaching without having to worry that exercises stop working or whether they work on every Windows and Mac computer in a large cohort of students.

## The student interface

The student run a jupyter notebook on their own computer in a way that lets them focus on content and learning without the frustration by library incompatibilities and platform specific dependencies. 

On both Mac and Windows, running the following command, prompts the student to select course and exercise and then downloads a folder with a jupyter notebook.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin download
```

The student runs the following command, which again prompts for course and exercise and launches JupyterLab from an environment on the student's computer with all required dependencies preinstalled.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin jupyter
```

The environment and notebook is exactly the same, wether on Mac or Windows, allowing them to work together, compare results, and receive uniform and unambiguous feedback from instructors.

## The educator interface

Educators with limited computational skills can develop and distribute jupyter exercises that will run year on year on the the diverse Mac and Windows computers of large cohorts of students.

Running the following command prompts the educator for course and exercise name and creates a new exercise. 

Plugin `exercise` from franklin-jupyter

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise new
```

The following command command prompts the educator for course and exercise. It then retrieves the exercise, launches jupyter in an appropriate environment, waits while the educator edits the notebook, and then automatically makes the edited notebook available to students in an environment automatically generated to accommodate any new dependencies resulting from changes to the notebook.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
franklin exercise edit
```

## Installing Miniforge Python

Although franklin works with any python3 distribution, but the [Miniforge distribution](https://conda-forge.org/download/) is strongly recommended.

Miniforge is a conda-based community driven Python distribution. It is more robust and does not have the license requirements for large companies now imposed by Anaconda. 

## Installing Franklin

Students can install franklin into a conda environment like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda install -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin
```

Educators also install the `franklin-educator` plugin:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
conda install -c conda-forge -c munch-group franklin franklin-educator
```

In courses using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) they can install like this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
pixi workspace add channel munch-group
pixi add franklin franklin-educator
```

Once installed Franklin updates automatically through either conda or pixi. This ensures that any update or bugfix is automatically available to students.

## GitLab administrator setup

Franklin only requires a GitLab group named 'Franklin', with subgroups for each course holding the exercise repositories.
