In order to grant permission to delete and create project you will have to be a owner of that subgroup. This is done by first inviting the person you want to own a subgroup to the main group as a reader. Then you add them to the subgroup once more and choose them as a owner of the particular subgroup.

The course coordinater should be the owner of the subgroup of their course. 

TØ instructors should be maintainers on the subgroup

Both instructors and course coordinators should only have guest or reporter privalleges on the main group (franklin)
